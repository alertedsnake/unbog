One day in the past, a friend and I were talking about optimizing code, 
and he mentioned he was writing a perl program to "unboggle" - that is, 
to take a random seqence of letters and generate words from it.  Just 
like you do when playing Boggle.

I thought this would be a great exercize, so I started it too.  The first
iteration took 20 seconds, not counting dictionary load time.

The second 2 seconds.

Then 1,

    then 0.5

        then 0.25

            then 0.0212.


Some time after that, I started to learn Python, so I wrote 
a Python unboggle program.

Try it yourself!
